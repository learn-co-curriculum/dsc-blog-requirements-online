# Blog Requirements

You must complete at least seven blog posts in order to graduate. These requirements are designed to give you the best opportunity to showcase your knowledge and skill to potential employers. These blog posts must...

* Be published on the web in a single place (your blog)
* Discuss data science topics
* Contain only material you wrote or include proper attribution
* Have high-quality content and formatting
* Be something you would proudly show to a potential employer

After writing your blog posts, you must submit URLs to them in the "Blog Post #X" assignments in the Milestones course. Your teacher will grade each blog as complete or incomplete.

Recommendations for writing good blog posts that would meet these requirements are available in the [Blogging][] lesson.
