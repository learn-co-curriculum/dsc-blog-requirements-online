# Blog Requirements & Submission

This lesson describes the Flatiron School blog requirements and submission process. These requirements are designed to give you the best opportunity to deepen your knowledge, practice communication skills, and showcase yourself to potential employers.

## Blog Requirements

You must set up a publicly accessible blog and publish at least seven blog posts on it in order to graduate. Your instructor may provide due dates for your blog posts throughout the program to help you complete them in a timely fashion - these due dates are mandatory. Your blog posts must...

* Discuss data science topics
* Be composed primarily of original material you wrote
* Include proper attribution
* Have high-quality content and formatting
* Be something you would proudly show to a potential employer

## Blog Post Submission

After writing your blog posts, you must submit URLs to them in the "Blog Post #X" assignments in the Milestones course. Your teacher will grade each blog post as Complete or Incomplete.

## Recommendations

Here are some recommendations to help you meet these requirements:

* Spread out the timing of your blog posts evenly throughout the program so you don't end up with a backlog. One way to do this is to complete one blog related to each project, and two others related to interesting topics you learn about during the program and want to dig deeper into.
* Start each blog post at least a week before it's due so that you don't end up pressed for time and rushing to finish.
* Find someone in your cohort to swap your blog posts for peer review prior to submitting.
* Review suggestions for choosing topics and writing good blog posts from the [Blogging Overview][] lesson.
