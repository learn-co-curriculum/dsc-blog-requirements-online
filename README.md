# Blog Requirements

You must complete at least seven blog posts in order to graduate. These requirements are designed to give you the best opportunity to showcase your knowledge and skill to potential employers. These blog posts must...

* Be published on the web in a single place (your blog)
* Discuss data science topics
* Be composed primarily of original material you wrote
* Include proper attribution
* Have high-quality content and formatting
* Be something you would proudly show to a potential employer

You must complete your blogs by any due dates given by your instructor, and all of your blogs must be completed by the end of your program.

After writing your blog posts, you must submit URLs to them in the "Blog Post #X" assignments in the Milestones course. Your teacher will grade each blog as complete or incomplete.

## Recommendations

Here are some recommendations to help you meet these requirements:

* Spread out the timing of your blog posts evenly throughout the program so you don't end up with a backlog. An easy way to do this is to complete one blog related to each project, and two others related to other topics you're interested in.
* Start each blog post at least a week before it's due so that you don't end up pressed for time and rushing to finish.
* Find someone in your cohort to swap your blog posts for peer review prior to submitting.
* Review suggestions for choosing topics and writing good blog posts from the [Blogging][] lesson.
