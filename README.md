# Blog Requirements & Submission (Online)

This lesson describes the Flatiron School blog requirements and submission process. These requirements are designed to give you the best opportunity to deepen your knowledge, practice communication skills, and showcase yourself to potential employers.

## Blog Requirements

You must set up a publicly accessible blog and publish at least seven blog posts on it in order to graduate. Blog posts must be submitted on the following schedule:

* Phase 1: One post
* Phase 2: Two posts
* Phase 3: One post
* Phase 4: Two posts
* Phase 5: One post

Your blog posts must...

* Discuss data science topics
* Be composed primarily of original material you wrote
* Include proper attribution
* Have high-quality content and formatting
* Be something you would proudly show to a potential employer

## Blog Post Submission

After writing your blog posts, you must submit URLs to them in the "Blog Post" assignments. Your teacher will grade each blog post as Complete or Incomplete.

## Recommendations

Here are some recommendations to help you meet these requirements:

* Review suggestions for choosing topics and writing good blog posts from the [Blogging Overview](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-blogging-overview) lesson.
* For the phases with two blog posts, do one post related to your project and another related to a topic you'd like to explore in more depth.
* Start each blog post at least a week before it's due so that you don't end up pressed for time and rushing to finish.
* Find someone in your cohort to swap your blog posts with for peer review prior to submitting.
